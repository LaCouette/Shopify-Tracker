# How to make this work:

The script opens python/to-track.json to track shops and python/data.json to push data.

Here is an example to-track.json

    {
        "urls":
            [
                "https://pukingball.com/products/the-original-puking-ball",
                "https://www.fruitybullet.com/products/the-fruity-bullet"
            ]
        
    }
